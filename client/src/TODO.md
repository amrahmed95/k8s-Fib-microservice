# TODO: Refactor FibPage Component

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Convert FibPage from class component to functional component using React hooks (useState, useEffect).
- [ ] Add state for loading indicators and error messages.
- [ ] Implement error handling for API calls in fetchValues and fetchIndexes functions.
- [ ] Add input validation to ensure index is a positive integer in handleSubmit.
- [ ] Refetch data (fetchValues and fetchIndexes) after successful submission to update UI immediately.
- [ ] Add loading states during API calls (fetching and submitting).
- [ ] Improve JSX structure for better accessibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels, proper form elements).
- [ ] Handle edge cases such as empty input, non-numeric values, and prevent submission if invalid.
- [ ] Test the enhanced component to ensure functionality works as expected.
